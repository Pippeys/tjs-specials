# Jordan-Scott-Ted Test Repository

This is a repository just for us to try out coordinating a project on Github

# Current Project Idea
Camping locations webscraper

Outline:
	Get picture + name of location from reddit.com/r/norcalhiking
	Othe websites might be necessary because of inconsistent title naming
	Get gps coordinates from name and google maps api
	Use Geosphere library for mapping?
	Plot locations and pictures onto custom google map
	????
	Profit!
